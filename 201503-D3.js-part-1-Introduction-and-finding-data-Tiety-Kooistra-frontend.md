###Introduction.
>"D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation." [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)

**In short: you can make awesome interactive charts and maps with D3.js.**  

In this blog series I will describe the process of building an interactive map that renders arrests per province in the Netherlands.  

The series is split up in several parts which will be each usable as a stand alone example.  
1. Introduction and finding data.
2. Prepare your mapdata with QGIS.
3. Render a map.
4. Adding the additional data.
5. Zoom functionality.
6. Add labels to the map.
7. Adding a legend to interpret the data.
8. Interactive tooltips for detailed information.
9. Display several years of data with a time series.

###Finding Data
In this first blog I will now focus on finding useful data for rendering in D3.js.  
**Maps**  
For mapdata there are three options, you either need a JSON, GeoJSON or TopoJSON file to load into D3. Lets take a look at some data sources that can be used for generating stunning maps.  
- [Natural Earth.](http://www.naturalearthdata.com)  
- [Imergis.](http://www.imergis.nl/asp/44.asp)  
- [Opendata.](http://opendata.arcgis.com/)  

And the list go's on and on. With a google search on GIS data you will get a lot of hits. The above mentioned I have used before in several projects. For this project I will use the [map](http://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/975552a98c8241b39d531b0a0b98a78f_0) of the Dutch provinces.

Problem with most of the datasets is that you need other programs and/or applications to manipulate the data, before you can use it in D3. There are two main problems. First, most of the maps you will find online will be in the shapefile format, like the one we use. Secondly, the datasets are ridiculously big for use on the web.

To tackle these problems you usually need a GIS program. There are a lot of GIS programs around, like:  
- *Open source*  
  - [QGIS.](http://www2.qgis.org/)  
- *Paid*  
  - [ArcGIS.](http://www.arcgis.com/features/)  
  - [Mapinfo.](http://www.mapinfo.com/)  

Online there are also tools to help with the important tasks mentioned above. In my opinion they can't replace the quality of a GIS program yet, but most likely I haven't found the really good ones, while I'm used to working with both ArcGIS and QGIS. Suggestions for good online alternatives are of course welcome in the comments section under this post.

**Data**  
In the maps from Natural Earth or from other sources, you will usually find extra data that you can use for making an interactive map, like: region and subregion information, population statistics or information about the GDP. But it is also possible to add the data later with D3. There are a lot of [options](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Requests) for the data format, most important are JSON, CSV and TSV. In a later part I will show how to work with this data in a JSON format in the example project.

As with the maps you can find an abundance of data on the net. Some examples:
- [World bank group](http://data.worldbank.org/) *Economic information about the whole world.*
- [WHO](http://www.who.int/gho/en/) *Global health data.*
- [CBS](http://www.cbs.nl) *Statistical data about The Netherlands.*

For the example project I will use [arrests data](http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=81960ned&D1=14&D2=0&D3=6-17&D4=a&HDR=T,G3&STB=G1,G2&VW=T) from the CBS. The data was manipulated to get a number of arrests per 100.000 [inhabitants](http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=03759ned&D1=0,17&D2=129-132&D3=5-16&D4=11-25&HDR=T,G1&STB=G3,G2&VW=T), to be able to compare the provinces without the distortion of population. With the CBS you are allowed to download all their data in several formats. With some manipulations in any spreadsheet program or in a code editor you can shape the data to represent what you want to show on your map.

**Good luck finding data for your own projects. I will write in the next post about the use of QGIS to prepare the mapdata for rendering with D3.js.**
