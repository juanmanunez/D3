In the previous post we collected a [shapefile map](http://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/975552a98c8241b39d531b0a0b98a78f_0) of the provinces of The Netherlands and we downloaded data about arrests and population from the CBS. In my [github repository](https://github.com/tietyk/D3.js) you can find the original data and the final products of all the blogs in this series.

###QGIS
In this post I'll explain how you can manipulate a shapefile map into a usable and smaller GeoJSON file. To accomplish this task I will use a geographic information system (GIS), namely [QGIS.](http://qgis.org) This is an open source system you can [download](http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) free of charge under GNU licence.

Open QGIS desktop
layer (menu bar) add layer, add vector layer
add vector layer
browse to  Provincies.shp

###Simplify
vector (menu bar) geometry tools (pull down menu), simplify geometry
simplify tolelance 0.0005 (pop up)
save as new file
add result to canvas

1.5 - 2 times bigger then the shapefile, to keep in mind.

###GeoJSON
right click on layer (layers menu left of the screen)
save as
select GeoJSON
make sure projection you save to is WGS 84 we need a compatible projection with D3

**We finished making a suitable GeoJSON file to use with D3. In the next post I will explain how to draw the map with D3.js.**
